# =========== Part 1: Regularized Logistic Regression ============
# In this part, you are given a dataset with data points that are not
# linearly separable. However, you would still like to use logistic
# regression to classify the data points.
#
# To do so, you introduce more features to use -- in particular, you add
# polynomial features to our data matrix (similar to polynomial
# regression).

# Note that mapFeature also adds a column of ones for us, so the intercept
# term is handled

# ============= Part 2: Regularization and Accuracies =============
# Optional Exercise:
# In this part, you will get to try different values of lambda and
# see how regularization affects the decision coundart
#
# Try the following values of lambda (0, 1, 10, 100).
#
# How does the decision boundary change when you vary lambda? How does
# the training set accuracy vary?
